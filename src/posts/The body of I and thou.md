### Summary

The structural habits of our body filter our experience of the world around us and reduce the incoming data that contributes to our thought and behavioural patterns.

If we want to try something new, we have to create the possibility of becoming something new. Specifically, what is the shape of the body that is ready for Martin Buber's _encounter_?

A simplistic view of the body is to think of it in terms of _open_ and _closed_. An concentrating body might be a closed body, tight in its efforts to repel distractions and external pressures. Perhaps the opposite – an open body – will provide the fertile ground that we need to encourage _encounter_.

We can't demand _encounter_, but we can learn to open the body to possibility.

## Living in a body

There are ways to be in a body, to be out of a body, and for a body itself to be.

Martin Buber’s idea of _encounter_ requires a specific set of conditions to be available in the body, and whilst we can't make encounter happen, perhaps we can develop those conditions in us so that encounter is at least possible, if not likely.

However, the very first task is to learn how _you_ live in your body. Where do you move from in your body - do you walk forwards from your head, your chest, you core, your feet? When walking are you actually _in_ your body, or just in front of it?

## What is a body?

I realise that I may mean something different from the usual when I refer to a body, so let's explore that a bit. A body is both a physical entity _and_ a sensory environment.

### The nuts and bolts

The physical body is a tensegrity device - one that is shaped by the interplay of compression and tension. Our tissues – muscles, tendons, fascia – pull and create tension. The skeleton pushes back, resisting that compression, creating a network of continuous tension that keeps the body upright.

That body works at its most efficient and effective when all those pressures and tensions are in balance.

### Beyond the mechanical

Thomas Hanna coined the term _somatics_ to describe the aspects of the body that seem to reach beyond the physical, _the body as perceived from within, and as perceiving without_. Somatic work develops the conscious relationship with the body's nervous system, which encourages greater proprioceptive (kinaesthetic) awareness, often considered _the sixth sense_.

Our proprioceptive system, along with our vestibular system, stabilises our position throughout movement, and develops the precision necessary for complex and refined movements. The better our nervous processes perform, the more effectively and efficiently we can act. We can navigate gravity, unfamiliar terrain, and _demanding people_. These are the systems that allow us to maintain openness in the face of the incoming pressure from others.

### Back to Buber

For simplicity's sake, I view the body as either _open_ or _closed_, or _opening_ or _closing_. A body that is _open_, is open to something beyond it (an _Other_). A body that is _closed_ has put up hard boundaries around it, that the _Other_ may not penetrate^[For what it's worth, I think the Other does still penetrate, but the nature of that penetration is uncomfortable and uninvited. _I am not talking to you_ is a classic example of closing being an uncomfortable form of relationship.].

A clear requirement for engaging as _I-Thou_ is an open mind, a mind welcoming whatever comes^[Arguably, the opposite of what we use to engage as _I-It_: a closed mind, a mind that is analysing and classifying (reducing), a mind that is objectifying.]. If we assume that mind, body, and nervous system are supporting each other, then Buber's encountering body is also _open_, so what are the supporting qualities and structures for such a physicality?

Even if we're taking a philosophical stance, we have to consider our physical position. _We are first and foremost subject to gravity_. If we want to be free to respond to the world, we have to be able to move. Gravity may be support us in this, or dominate. It's our choice.^[How we respond to gravity _is_ a matter of choice, but because gravity is always upon us that choice was made a very long time ago and our day-to-day is constrained by habit. It is possible to make a different choice, but nurturing that choice and bringing it to fruition is a long process of melting away habitual strictures.].

And what navigates how gravity affects us? _Our body_. So, how is your relationship with gravity?
