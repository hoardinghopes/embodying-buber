Look at your hands awhile. Turn them over and study them, their curves and lines, maybe stretch the fingers open a few times as if receiving a gift and then release them.

Look now at one hand, thumb pointing upwards, and open it as if you're about to slide it around a mug of tea (it's even better if you have a mug of real tea there with you). Our hands are superconductors for thoughts; they move at the speed of light to reach out for things, to tap on keyboards, to move cursors across screens.

In fact, they often work so fast that we overlook _how_ they work. How they hold things; how they grip and grasp and tear and pull.

But your hands reflect _how you are_, so if they grip and grasp tighter, the likelihood is that the tightness will run throughout your body, that your structure will be (de-) formed by the desire or fear behind the gripping and grasping.

By contrast, if your hands are soft and gently expressive of your wants, the rest of your body will be so too.

This is not an invitation to be softly-waftly, but to notice how much effort we put into one thing and thence to explore how that effort runs throughout the rest of our body.

So let's get really specific: when you reach to wrap your fingers around the mug, what happens? Your fingers open just enough to move around the mug. As they do so, you may notice a light stretching along the inside of your palm and your fingers, as the finger pulleys (tendons) in there are stretched. Tendons are a dense form of fascia[^fn-fascia]. Healthy fascial sheets work like elastic – once stretched and released, they bounce back into their shorter form.

[^fn-fascia]: Fascia is made of collagen fibres. These collagen fibres are individually capable of lengthening under tension, and collectively they can stretch apart to double their inert length (that's quite a stretch). They can stretch and release both lengthways and sideways.

Once your thumb and fingers are either side of the mug, let them go. Notice _what you do_, and notice _what happens_.

It's entirely possible to switch from _opening_ your fingers to _closing_ them with both verbs representing deliberate actions. But it's more interesting to notice how we can open our fingers and then release them, just to have them bounce back into a closed shape around the mug[^fn-activepassive].

[^fn-activepassive]: The English language constrains our ability to express what we perceive, and by so doing actually limits our perception. We have active and passive voices for verbs: _I open the door_, and _the door is opened_. We are lacking a voice for things that just seem to happen. The opposite of _I open my hands_ sounds like it should be _I close my hands_. But then you have two actions: _opening_ and _closing_. What I am looking for is the _non-action_ of the fingers closing once the opening has been released. It's the bounce-back of the stretched tendons that isn't so easily expressed in English. For example, if I say _stop opening your hands_, do your fingers stiffen where they are, like a Pompeiian statue trying to ward off the volcanic eruption, or do they bounce back to a relaxed closed position? In other words, do you actively open and then actively stop, or do you actively open and then let that activity go?

See how comfortable that is? Notice how little effort you've applied to the mug. It's as if you're just keeping your hands warm. Now can you maintain that simple contact and lift the mug, or do you tighten up just before doing so?

Can you sense something else too – that your relationship with the mug is different? That you are less holding an object and more relating to an entity? That your hands are receiving the mug as well as holding it?[^fn-buber]

[^fn-buber]: Looking back towards [my earlier Buber articles](/posts/the-body-of-i-and-thou/), I suggested that we can't create Buberian _encounter_ on demand, but that we can set up the conditions that might allow _encounter_ to arise. If that's true, the more two-way our hands relate to the mug, the closer we are getting to setting up those conditions.

Of course, I'm not talking about holding a cup of tea. That's just a convenient study. I'm thinking about anything we strive for – object, idea, person, target, goal, ambition. How we hold ourselves vis-à-vis our goals decides the quality of our relationship with those goals. And the importance of the quality of our relationship with our goals ... is tomorrow's subject.

For now, enjoy your tea.
