## I don't exist.

I am formed and brought to life by relationship with others (incuding non-animate and non-human others).

Philosopher Martin Buber^[_I and Thou_, Martin Buber, 1923] wrote that there are two ways of being in the world. The most common mode is ego-centric. I am real, everything (everyone) else is an object in relation to me. I relate to them for what I can get from them.

The second mode places everything on an even footing – everything has its own value (beyond my ability to extract that value). In this second mode, a relationship is marked by the way it alters both parties.

That one of these modes sounds obvious and the other doesn't really make sense is a sign of the predominance of the first mode, which Buber framed as _I-It_. This is the mode in which we collect data, analyse, classify, extract. The _It_ is a thing to be utilised, known or put to work. There is necessarily a sense of distance between the experiencing _I_ and the experienced _It_. The _It_ is object to the _I_'s subject.

The second mode of *I-Thou* is both possible and necessary if we are to be fully human. It is a mode of _encounter_, where we enter into relationship with the object encountered, we participate in something  with that object, and both *I* and *Thou* are transformed by the relationship.
